Bank loan summary dashboard
This project involves tracking and analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to loan applications and disbursements. The KPIs include Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI). Each metric is monitored on a Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) basis to provide insights into loan portfolio performance and borrower financial health.

The project also differentiates between good and bad loans, with specific KPIs for each category. A comprehensive Loan Status Grid View is created to categorize and report on these metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Several charts are used for in-depth analysis, including:

Monthly Trends (Line Chart)
Regional Analysis (Filled Map)
Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart)
Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart)
Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart)
Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map). The objective is to develop a Details Dashboard that consolidates all essential loan-related metrics into a user-friendly interface, offering a holistic snapshot of the loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
